          My earliest memory of Weezer comes from 2001, when I first saw a video titled “H--- Pipe” on MTV. My mom sent my brother on a mission to discover what the blurred out word was. When he returned from school with news that it was “Hash Pipe,” we were all disappointed, hoping for something more risqué.</p>
          <p>I was seven years old. This was my first hint that Weezer might not be as cool as I thought.</p>

          <p>
          That’s why I was surprised when the releases of “Thank God For Girls” (Oct. 25) and “Do You Wanna Get High?” (Nov. 3) were accompanied by levels of coverage usually reserved for Justin Bieber, Adele and One Direction — the elite of the music industry. Rolling Stone promptly published articles following both releases, and an interview with Rivers Cuomo.</p>

          <p>YouTube comments on the songs varied from “Really loving this song! Reminds me of why I became a Weezer fan!﻿” to “well weezer are shit again﻿.”</p>

          <p>And the question is revived: Is Weezer cool? Were they ever?</p>

          <br> <div align="center"><img id="gif" src="images/sumo.gif"/></div><br>
          <p>
          Earlier this week, we posted this question on the Emerald Twitter account. 24 hours later, results were dubious. Out of 106 votes total, “no” won by 51 percent. </p>
          <p>
          For this article, the Emerald decided to speak with some of the band’s declared fans here at the University of Oregon, professional music critics, and others with a commitment to Weezer, because Weezer’s biggest fans are also its greatest critics.</p>

          <p>Steven Hyden, former writer for Grantland and Pitchfork, laid it out simply in an email: </p>

          <p>“Weezer was never cool. Not in the ‘90s, not in the ‘00s, and certainly not now. Perhaps there was a brief window of time when being a Weezer fan had some cachet post-Pinkerton/pre-Green Album, but the whole point of liking Weezer (and I suppose being in Weezer) is owning your inherent uncoolness.”</p>

          <p>For people like myself who grew up with Weezer — now looked at as one of the most influential rock bands of the ‘90s — Weezer was inherently cool. </p>
          <p>
          What rock star other than frontman Rivers Cuomo has (a) declared that he is “Tired Of Sex,” (b) gone to Harvard, and (c) traded in a life of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll for Shakespeare, celibacy and meditation?</p>

    <p>Today, when we speak of Weezer, we are usually talking about what the band did between 1994-2002. What followed was a decade-long dry spell of albums that are patently bad, even for a band that embraces that sort of thing.</p>

    <p>At my middle school, people seemed to turn on Weezer about a year after Make Believe, specifically, after “Beverly Hills” ran its course. Pretty soon, people only played “Beverly Hills” in jest to annoy others. One friend, in a true act of rebellion, defaced his homemade white Weezer t-shirt by replacing the “W” with a “G” to spell “Geezer.” He then wore it more proudly than ever.</p>

    <p>For a band that never released a popular album for the majority of current college students’ formative years, it left a lasting impact.</p>

    <p>“My guess is that Weezer hasn’t been cool since Pinkerton, really, but they keep fooling new generations of high school kids anyway,” said David Greenwald, music critic for The Oregonian.</p>

    <p>Silas Valentino, a contributor for The Village Voice and former Emerald staff writer took this notion one step further: </p>

    <p>“One day, I’m going to fall in love with a woman and she will have her complexities and her perfections. And I’ll be able to draw this beautiful comparison to Weezer where it’s like, ‘I see you for your Blue and I see you for your Pinkerton, but I also acknowledge your Make Believe.’ ”</p>

    <p>When describing why it’s possible to simultaneously love and hate Weezer, the phrase “endearing” was common. Weezer attempted to diversify its sound and the results were less than stellar. Instead of making a poor version of Pinkerton five times, they admirably kept attempting new things.</p>

    <p>For many fans, it doesn’t matter how bad the tracks get. Nathan Stevens, a KWVA DJ and UO student, said Rivers Cuomo would have to be filmed kicking puppies for Stevens to give up on the band.</p>

    <p>“The point of Weezer is that they were never cool,” Stevens said. “ ‘Buddy Holly’ is about not being cool, but also not giving a fuck. They’ve always been a dorky, nerdy, lovable, great band. I don't think cool has anything to do with it.” </p>

    <p>Other listeners, such as Eli Burch, a senior product design major at UO, have not followed modern Weezer closely. Burch said the first four albums helped shape his music experience when most other students were listening to hip-hop growing up. </p>

    <p>“I don’t think they’re cool again, but maybe they’ll prove me wrong,” Burch said. “I’m cheering for them, but I’m not very optimistic. I would love if they made an awesome comeback.”</p>

    <p>Loving Weezer goes hand-in-hand with hating Weezer. True fans accept the bad albums, as they wholeheartedly love the good ones. </p>
    <p>“Weezer is Kool-Aid,” Valentino said. “I’ll drink it every day and twice on Sunday. Weezer is definitely cool and relevant in 2015, as they will be for another 21 years, even though fresh fans are probably scarce. They made enough magic in that L.A. garage back in ‘94 to last a career.”<p/>

    <p>The future of Weezer is unwritten. In 1996, Pinkerton was panned. Rolling Stone readers voted it as the third worst album of the year, before doubling back in 2002 to name it the 16th greatest album of all time.<p/>

    <p>“I don’t need anything more from Weezer at this point,” Stevens said. “If there’s something amazing they come up with, I will be so, so happy, but they gave me those two albums of my childhood [Blue and Pinkerton]. I don’t want to demand anything.”<p/>

    <p>So after all this, is it possible to declare Weezer cool again? The results were pretty evenly split. More people said yes, but the arguments that Weezer has never been cool were more convincing. There’s only one question left to ask after an inconclusive study: <p/>

    <p>Does it matter if Weezer is cool?<p/>

    <p>No. Not at all. <p/>

    <p>What matters is that Weezer is one of the most interesting bands in present times that has reached the top, plummeted to rock bottom and may be ascending once again. If the next step of Weezer’s journey is to bottom out again, there will still be fans waving the Weezer flag as proud as ever.<p/>

    <p>Nick Miller, an Oregon State University student I grew up with who reintroduced me to Weezer this past summer, had this to say about the contradiction that is being a Weezer fan:</p>

    <p>
    “When you love something, you gotta love its faults too. You gotta accept [Weezer] for what they are, and those terrible, terrible records are a part of who they are now,” he said. “It’s unfortunate, but it’s a part of it.”</p>

  <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px;color:white;"  id="Quote2">"Weezer is not cool."<br>--Dahlia Bazzaz, editor-in-chief</div>
  <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px; color:white;" id="Quote1">Weezer can never be 'cool'. At their height, Weezer's appeal was their nerd aesthetic and 'fuck the cool kids' attitude. Then by the time Beverly Hills hit, they were overexposed and thus uncool in a different way. Thus they can only ever return to 'cool because they're uncool' vibe.<br>--Chris Berg, video games and technology writer</div>
  <div class="sho"  style="font-size:16px;color:white;" id="Quote3">I do not have a sentimental relationship with Weezer as a band like most of my generation does. A lot of the time when I hear about Weezer, it seems like a nostalgia thing, so my sense of Weezer is a band that made a couple really solid albums early on, and they're not a group that I would want to throw their music on very often.
I don't really see Weezer as ever having been cool. Maybe during The Blue Album. On the one hand they have the “Buddy Holly” thing, but to have the slow, chugging guitar style, it’s really cool.
People hated Pinkerton. By the time people realized Pinkerton was this great, undiscovered gem, Weezer had already been uncool for a while.
Any coolness Weezer has is in spite of them being uncool.
Final Verdict: As far as the mainstream goes, I would say they’re not cool, but they’re beloved, like a big slobbering sheepdog.<br>--Daniel Bromfield, associate Arts and Culture editor</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px;color:white;" id="Quote4">In elementary school, they were a pretty integral part of my music experience. It didn't occur to me that they could be anything other than totally cool.
The way they precariously handle their fame is the most compelling and stressful thing about them as a band. I don't have expectations for them anymore, because I don’t know where they’re going to go, or what they’re going to do with it. They’ve always been a band that alchemizes how uncool they are and makes that into something totally different. If they keep on that track where they’re very self-aware, but not spiraling out of control, making dorky Lost references, I think that would be pretty cool.
There’s always the subtext that Weezer might be in on the joke, which is the troubling part of watching them tumble down a mid-career slope.
<br> --Emerson Malone, senior Arts and Culture editor</div>
      <div class="sho"style="font-size:16px;color:white;"  id="Quote5">Weezer has always been cool. They just haven't been popular as of late due to their albums in the 2000s sounding too much like their stuff in the ‘90s. These two new songs sound like modern soft rock, which is why they have become relevant again. But they never will or have been super popular due to Weezer being in a niche. Hard and soft rock have diverged into pop rock and punk rock. It's rare to see normal rock groups make it really big these days like Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys, let alone a soft punk rock group like Weezer. While they will never be super big, I still like them and am glad to find their music is finally appealing to modern audiences again.
          <br> --Eric Schucht, science and research reporter
      </div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px;color:white;"  id="Quote6">For me, yes! Weezer is cool again.<br>  --Madison Layton, women's volleyball reporter</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px;color:white;"  id="Quote7">I absolutely adore Weezer, even through its Hurley days. However, I haven't adored every song, and I definitely feel like I'm eating too many pieces of bitter dark chocolate when I listen to both of these songs. While I love dark chocolate, as I love Weezer, too much of the bitterness of it makes me retract from it.

Weezer's new singles are fuming with sick bitterness despite their almost ironic positive messages. I almost fell asleep during "Do You Want To Get High," as the lyrics meant nothing to me other than repetitive lines over and over again and the instrumentals reflected that same vibe. "Thank God For Girls" offended me, which is Weezer's best quality, but it offended me to the point where all I was asking afterward was why I wasted three minutes of my life listening. I have always been critical of Weezer's music, but have always loved at least one song on their albums, so I'm crossing my fingers that a piece of gold comes out of this pile.
      <br> --Olivia Decklar, Fraternity and Sorority Life reporter
      </div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px;color:white;"id="Quote8">I guess I never got on the "Weezer is dumb!" wagon as much as I was on the "Weezer is old!" wagon. I thought that just like any band that was emblematic of a single era, they lost their shine after a while.

I saw them at the Project Pabst in Portland this summer, and they were really fun and people were really into it. There was a huge Weezer flag. The W was blazing on the stage, like they are still proud of their brand. Brian Bell came onstage wearing a beer-sipping helmet that he ended up throwing into the crowd, and it was that same uncool-but-cool thing, you know?
      <br> --Scott Greenstone, managing producer
      </div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:16px;color:white;" id="Quote9">Weezer is cool again. I just love “Do You Wanna Get High” so much. It’s a step in the right direction. Weezer is cool again, but not in the way the Weeknd is cool. Weezer is always going to be nerd cool, or dad cool. Definitely still cool and relevant for now.

Almost immediately Weezer was accepted as an uncool band that championed its status. Paradoxically, it made them look cool. People initially gravitated towards Weezer because they were a relatable band. They looked like regular people, not pretentious rock stars. The masterful interplay between the guitar solo and falsetto singing on “Buddy Holly” doesn't hurt a band’s reputation either. Part of the reason Blue is still so loved today is because it never tries to be something it can't achieve. The music is mostly simple down-tuned, power-chord rock with brilliant lyrics. Who else (other than Spongebob) can make a song about a sweater interesting? Maybe this video, directed by Spike Jonze, was perfectly set in the Happy Days universe, as Weezer too would one day jump the shark. At the end, it’s The Fonz, not the band, who walks away with a woman on each arm while the band is accosted about Al’s fish.";

          description.innerHTML="After Blue, Cuomo went to Harvard to study Shakespeare and interact with real people. Returning to music, he wanted to “get back to the good life” of shaking booty and making sweet love, a longing for the very profession from which he needed respite. This was Cuomo’s comeback anthem. After the success of The Blue Album, he was able to bankroll a surgery to lengthen his left leg by 44 mm that required a lengthy recovery, hence the line “Broken, beaten down / Can't even get around / Without an old man cane / I fall and hit the ground.” When watching this video, it’s difficult to picture that Rivers was able to say he was “Tired Of Sex.” He is awkwardly camera shy and, fittingly, looks more like a Harvard student than a rock star. The music video makes it pretty easy to understand why the majority of fans initially hated Pinkerton. This video boasts split-frame camera effects that could only have been considered cool in the ‘90s, and even then, probably not. Although the album was almost universally hated by fans and critics at the time, Pinkerton has grown to be hailed as a masterpiece, further adding to the conundrum of the public perception of Weezer.";

        description.innerHTML="Today, it’s hard to classify The Green Album as a comeback album given the polarizing reaction to Pinkerton, but this was the LP that accompanied “Island In The Sun,” perhaps Weezer’s most perfect song. Weezer uses its trademark quirk to make a video of sweaty sumo wrestlers practicing seem like the perfect setting for a song called “Hash Pipe.” The video cuts between a hard-hitting sumo wrestling match, the guys from Weezer performing in the wrestling ring and the sumo wrestlers assisting Weezer with backup vocals. Arguably, this is Weezer’s “coolest” moment as a rock band. Rivers no longer appears as soft-spoken and camera shy as he did before, but he still delivers a deadpan camera stare-down. Every member of the band appears to have finally learned how to rock out confidently, and Brian Bell’s miraculous back bend at the 2:30 mark rivals Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal” lean. There’s a serious missed opportunity for Cuomo to challenge one of the sumo wrestlers.";

          description.innerHTML="Maladroit seems to be Weezer’s forgotten good album. Sales dropped after Green and it appeared to be an early moment of polarization among Weezer fans. This video is tricky. On the one hand, how awesome is it that they’re jamming with The Muppets? On the other, why the hell is one of the biggest rock bands of the time allowing its drummer Patrick Wilson to be Ms. Piggy’s sex slave? Cuomo also appears to be a prisoner to the cameraperson who was more likely than not reminding him to smile for the children. Statler and Waldorf’s ending comment of “They aren’t half bad.” “You’re right. They’re ALL bad!” was a nice nod to the original Jim Henson series, but now it just serves as a cruel, poignant foreshadowing for Weezer’s impending Dark Ages.";

This is the album where fans began to lose faith in Weezer, or give up altogether. “Beverly Hills” was a massive hit, but the rest of Make Believe lacked the typical Weezer punch that the early records seemed to have loaded in surplus. The tone slipped from “Say It Ain’t So,” a harrowing song about Cuomo’s father and stepfather’s struggle with alcoholism to jokey songs like “We Are All On Drugs.” Whether they actually desired to live like California kings or they were just being goofballs is irrelevant. The songwriting began to plummet."

          description.innerHTML="This is the last gasp of greatness on an otherwise forgettable album. Unfortunately, “Pork And Beans” had a fantastic video that stuffs together every YouTube star of 2008 into a very dense three-minute time capsule of YouTube’s renaissance period. Despite the single’s star-studded turnout, no such support system shows up to defend any other track on The Red Album. Cuomo untangles his thoughts on fame in the chorus: “I’mma do the things that I wanna do / I ain’t got a thing to prove to you / I’ll eat my candy with the pork and beans / Excuse my manners if I make a scene / I ain’t gonna wear the clothes that you like / I’m fine and dandy with the me inside / One look in the mirror and I’m tickled pink / I don’t give a hoot about what you think.” Whether he actually gave a hoot or not, “The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived” is awful — even if it is meant as a joke. It’s not endearingly bad like Tommy Wiseau in The Room. It’s just bad, and it forever tarnished “Pork And Beans” reputation. In interviews conducted for this article, The Red Album was consistently earmarked as the low point of Weezer’s career.";

          description.innerHTML="For Weezer to maintain its sense of humor through this period is key. Many “cool” rock bands would have broken up after losing a large percentage of its fan base, but Weezer kept chugging along, releasing new albums at an excessive rate. As the only inhabitants of “Weezerville,” the members of the band compete for the attention of a new woman in town. In the courting process, Scott Shriner receives an arrow through the heart, Brian Bell chops his arm off with a chainsaw trick gone awry and Patrick Wilson gets hit by Rivers Cuomo’s car. This song is probably not as bad as you remember it being.";

          description.innerHTML="This apology anthem about taking it “back to the shack” serves as Weezer’s return to form as Weezer. Cuomo opens up about his personal life in an effective way for the first time since Pinkerton and the results are a song that is finally musically interesting as well as lyrically significant. The reason this song is so effective is because it’s not just a shallow attempt at trying to draw fans back. Cuomo presumably learned what his music means to fans while on one of the many “Weezer Cruises.” The lyrics feel like a conversational apology to the people who matter most after he got his life and music heading in the right direction again.";

We’re going to cheat here and use “Run Away” instead. This song, co-written by Cuomo and Ryan Adams is actually a solid song. Most sensible people recognized that Weezer had just named an album after a semi-obscure character from Lost, and expected this album to be bad, so it may never have received a fair shot. Reviews were generally positive, but this is where the “cool” of Weezer had its greatest effect. After listening to Hurley a few times, it is not nearly as bad as expected. Upon release, people wanted to hate it, so they did.";
