          <!--FIRST P -->
  <p>My earliest memory of Weezer comes from 2001 when my mom, older brother and I first saw the “Hash Pipe” video on MTV. The title was censored to read “H--- Pipe,” so my mom sent my brother on a mission to discover what the blurred out word was. When he came back from school with news that it was “Hash Pipe,” we were all disappointed, hoping for something more risque.</p>
  <p>At the age of seven, this was the first of many Weezer-related disappointments to come.</p>
  <p>I was born in 1994, the year Weezer released The Blue Album, and like many others of this generation, I found it difficult to classify Weezer – one of the biggest rock bands of our birth period – as anything other than “cool.” The occupation of being in a band seemed to be what made rock stars cool, not the other way around. As a kid, the notion of an “uncool rock star” seemed like a contradiction, so Weezer was inherently cool.
    <br>       <img id="gif" src="images/sumo.gif"/><br>
  </p>
  <p>
  But as I grew more familiar with music, it became obvious that there are, without a doubt, uncool rock stars. Weezer may in fact be the prototype for uncool rock stars. </p>
  <p>
  What rock star other than Rivers Cuomo has (a) declared that he is “Tired Of Sex,” (b) gone to Harvard, and (c) traded in a life of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll for Shakespeare, celibacy and meditation? </p>
  <p>
  For people who grew up with Weezer, it is easy to call them cool, but what about those who</p>
  <p>
  Weezer is a rare breed of band that you simply cannot judge by whether you like or dislike the music. As the album quality plummeted faster than the U.S. National Debt, people were forced to decide whether or not to give up on the band, or keep rooting, knowing that Cuomo may one day write another song as powerful as “Say It Ain’t So.” But then Raditude, Hurley and Death To False Metal were released in a dreadful 12-month span. </p>
  <p>
  “Beverly Hills” was a breakout hit when I was in fifth grade. I somehow managed to hear it once that year, then not again until someone hid a boombox in their locker and played “Beverly Hills” to annoy everyone within earshot.</p>
  <p>
  This was about the time that everyone had formally turned on Weezer, circa 2007.
  In a true act of rebellion, a friend of mine defaced his homemade white Weezer t-shirt to instead spell “Geezer.” Listening to Weezer now seemed like an easy way to lose friends.</p>
  <p>For this article, I dedicated an afternoon to listening to the “dark ages” of Weezer, every album from Make Believe (2006) to Death To False Metal (2010).</p>
  <p>I cannot recommend doing this. Ever.</p>

    <p>Today, when we speak of Weezer, we are usually talking about what transpired between 1994-2002. We seem to ignore the unignorable: a decade-long dry spell of albums that are patently bad, even for a band that embraces that sort of thing. </p>
  <p>
  This is why I was so shocked to see the music world’s coverage of Weezer’s two newest singles, “Thank God For Girls” and “Do You Wanna Get High?” elevated to an abnormal level of acceptance. Within hours of their releases, Rolling Stone had posts about each single’s video on Twitter and Facebook, and a brief feature article about the backstory of “Do You Wanna Get High?”</p>
  <p>It seems as if Weezer is back. But can it really be true? Sure the singles were both decent, but are fans really ready to forgive Hurley, Raditude, The Red album and Make Believe?</p>
  <p>In researching this story, I conducted a number of interviews, and everyone shared a genuine air of excitement for simply being asked to talk about Weezer. It is a band with a downright passionate fan base, and the rare breed of band in which everybody, fan or not, seems to have a story. Generally the biggest fans are the harshest critics, so talking to declared Weezer fans seemed to be the most promising research avenue. </p>
  <p>Is there a way to define cool? Not really. Cool is subjective for each individual, but as a whole, it can pretty easy to distinguish the good, the bad and the Raditude, as well as the public perception of the band at the time.</p>

      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote1">Weezer can never be 'cool'. At their height, Weezer's appeal was their nerd aesthetic and 'fuck the cool kids' attitude. Then by the time Beverly Hills hit, they were overexposed and thus uncool in a different way. Thus they can only ever return to 'cool because they're uncool' vibe.</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px"  id="Quote2">Weezer is not cool.</div>
      <div class="sho"  style="font-size:14px"id="Quote3">I do not have a sentimental relationship with Weezer as a band like most of my generation does. A lot of the time when I hear about Weezer, it seems like a nostalgia thing, so my sense of Weezer is a band that made a couple really solid albums early on, and they're not a group that I would want to throw their music on very often.
I don't really see Weezer as ever having been cool. Maybe during The Blue Album. On the one hand they have the “Buddy Holly” thing, but to have the slow, chugging guitar style, it’s really cool.
People hated Pinkerton. By the time people realized Pinkerton was this great, undiscovered gem, Weezer had already been uncool for a while.
Any coolness Weezer has is in spite of them being uncool.
Final Verdict: As far as the mainstream goes, I would say they’re not cool, but they’re beloved, like a big slobbering sheepdog.</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote4">In elementary school, they were a pretty integral part of my music experience. It didn't occur to me that they could be anything other than totally cool.
The way they precariously handle their fame is the most compelling and stressful thing about them as a band. I don't have expectations for them anymore, because I don’t know where they’re going to go, or what they’re going to do with it. They’ve always been a band that alchemizes how uncool they are and makes that into something totally different. If they keep on that track where they’re very self-aware, but not spiraling out of control, making dorky Lost references, I think that would be pretty cool.
There’s always the subtext that Weezer might be in on the joke, which is the troubling part of watching them tumble down a mid-career slope.</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote5">Weezer has always been cool. They just haven't been popular as of late due to their albums in the 2000s sounding too much like their stuff in the ‘90s. These two new songs sound like modern soft rock, which is why they have become relevant again. But they never will or have been super popular due to Weezer being in a niche. Hard and soft rock have diverged into pop rock and punk rock. It's rare to see normal rock groups make it really big these days like Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys, let alone a soft punk rock group like Weezer. While they will never be super big, I still like them and am glad to find their music is finally appealing to modern audiences again.</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote6">For me, yes! Weezer is cool again.</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote7">I absolutely adore Weezer, even through its Hurley days. However, I haven't adored every song, and I definitely feel like I'm eating too many pieces of bitter dark chocolate when I listen to both of these songs. While I love dark chocolate, as I love Weezer, too much of the bitterness of it makes me retract from it.

Weezer's new singles are fuming with sick bitterness despite their almost ironic positive messages. I almost fell asleep during "Do You Want To Get High," as the lyrics meant nothing to me other than repetitive lines over and over again and the instrumentals reflected that same vibe. "Thank God For Girls" offended me, which is Weezer's best quality, but it offended me to the point where all I was asking afterward was why I wasted three minutes of my life listening. I have always been critical of Weezer's music, but have always loved at least one song on their albums, so I'm crossing my fingers that a piece of gold comes out of this pile.</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote8">I guess I never got on the "Weezer is dumb!" wagon as much as I was on the "Weezer is old!" wagon. I thought that just like any band that was emblematic of a single era, they lost their shine after a while.

I saw them at the Project Pabst in Portland this summer, and they were really fun and people were really into it. There was a huge Weezer flag. The W was blazing on the stage, like they are still proud of their brand. Brian Bell came onstage wearing a beer-sipping helmet that he ended up throwing into the crowd, and it was that same uncool-but-cool thing, you know?</div>
      <div class="sho" style="font-size:14px" id="Quote9">Weezer is cool again. I just love “Do You Wanna Get High” so much. It’s a step in the right direction. Weezer is cool again, but not in the way the Weeknd is cool. Weezer is always going to be nerd cool, or dad cool. Definitely still cool and relevant for now.</div>

Almost immediately Weezer was accepted as an uncool band that championed its status. Paradoxically, it made them look cool. People initially gravitated towards Weezer because they were a relatable band. They looked like regular people, not pretentious rock stars. The masterful interplay between the guitar solo and falsetto singing on “Buddy Holly” doesn\'t hurt a band’s reputation either. Part of the reason Blue is still so loved today is because it never tries to be something it can\'t achieve. The music is mostly simple down-tuned, power-chord rock with brilliant lyrics. Who else (other than Spongebob) can make a song about a sweater interesting? Maybe this video, directed by Spike Jonze, was perfectly set in the Happy Days universe, as Weezer too would one day jump the shark. At the end, it’s Fonzie, not the band, who walks away with a woman on each arm while the band is accosted about Al’s fish.";

Returning to music, he wanted to “get back to the good life” of shaking booty and making sweet love, a longing for the very profession from which he needed respite. This was Cuomo’s comeback anthem. After the success of The Blue Album, he was able to bankroll a surgery to lengthen his left leg by 44 mm that required a lengthy recovery, hence the line “Broken, beaten down / Can't even get around / Without an old man cane / I fall and hit the ground.” When watching this video, it’s difficult to picture that Rivers was able to say he was “Tired Of Sex.” He is awkwardly camera shy and looks more like a Harvard student than a rock star. Wait a second… The music video makes it pretty easy to understand why the majority of fans initially hated Pinkerton. This video boasts split-frame camera effects that could only ever have been considered cool in the ‘90s, but even then, probably not. Although the album was almost universally hated by fans and critics at the time, Pinkerton has grown to be hailed as a masterpiece, further adding to the conundrum of the public perception of Weezer.";

          description.innerHTML="Today, it’s hard to classify The Green Album as a comeback album given the polarizing perception of Pinkerton, but this was the rocker that accompanied “Island In The Sun,” perhaps Weezer’s most perfect song. Weezer uses its trademark quirk to make a video of sweaty sumo wrestlers practicing seem like the perfect setting for a song called “Hash Pipe.” The video interchangeably cuts between a hard-hitting sumo wrestling match, the guys from Weezer performing in the wrestling ring and the sumo wrestlers assisting Weezer with backup vocals. Arguably, this is Weezer’s “coolest” moment as a rock band. Rivers no longer appears as taciturn and camera shy as he did before, but he still delivers a deadpan camera stare-down. Every member of the band appears to have finally learned how to rock out confidently, and Brian Bell’s miraculous back bend at the 2:30 mark rivals Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal” lean. There’s a serious missed opportunity for Cuomo to challenge one of the sumo wrestlers.";
